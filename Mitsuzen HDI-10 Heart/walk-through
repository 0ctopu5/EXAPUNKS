First get a value from #NERV CNS and swizzle the value to only the tens place (ignore
ones value and whether negative or positive). This tens value will need to be stored in
global (M) memory to transfer to other EXAs

Second, copy the M value to T register of both EXAs, as this will count down by 1
for each value written to SA-N and AV-N to know when to stop writing values.

Third, a ruleset or ledger of static values needs to be available for EXAs at
SA-N and AV-N to copy. Or, as part of it's own instruction loop while counting down
from tens value of M register.
