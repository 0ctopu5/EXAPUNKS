// Thoughts of how to tackle the solution (problem-solving, more than coding):

// Objective is to dispense all available cash from all connected ATMs.

First, navigate to the area just before going into the "room" with the ATM with a single EXA

Second, replicate EXAs to fill each "room"

Third, read the #CASH to see if there's a lot or a little left

Fourth, run a repeating #DISP function to get the total #CASH down to less than 10 in the ATMs

Fifth, run a separate repeating #DISP function to get rid of the known #CASH left (less than 10)
